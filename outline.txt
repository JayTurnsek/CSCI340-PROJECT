Alife population simulation, with different morals/teamwork tested:

- population of n subjects
- must collect food, or will die (each gen)
- predators where food is, chance of death
- if food collected, chance of reproduction
- if no food collected, dies

behaviors:

BASELINE,

SELFISHNESS
vs.
HEROISM,

GREEN-BEARD ALTRUISM
vs.
TARGETED HATE

to test:
varying;
    - population sizes
    - predator kill rates
    - reproduction rates
crossover between types


representation:
individual class
    - behavior typing, getBehavior()
    - hasFood()
population:
    - list of individuals


PSEUDOCODE FOR BASELINE:

on each generation:
    Until entire population forages:
        two individuals try to go get food from a tree (two food):
            if predator present (random):
                50/50 chance on which individual is killed
            if individual survives, granted food
        IF ONE LEFT OVER, 50/50 on keep/kill
    for every individual:
        if food obtained:
            reproduction occurs.
            no fancy stuff just another one is added to population

see if this works
it does

good shit
